FILE UPLOAD FIX - RESTART REQUIRED

The file upload issue has been FIXED with better error detection.

WHAT TO DO NOW:

1. STOP the backend server (Ctrl+C)

2. TEST environment variables:
   node test-env.js

3. If Cloudinary shows "NOT SET":
   - Add to .env file:
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   
   - Get from: https://cloudinary.com/console

4. START server again:
   npm run dev

5. Look for:
   [OK] Cloudinary configured successfully for chat uploads

TESTING:

Test if Cloudinary is working:
  curl http://localhost:5000/api/chat/upload-status

Should return: "configured": true
